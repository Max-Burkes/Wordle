# Wordle
## Description
This project is based on the popular New York Times game Wordle. It functions like the NYT game allowing users on the HTML page to guess 5-letter words up to 6 times until they guess the secret word. The game is run on a styled HTML page and the logic is controlled by a Javascript script to allow ease in changing the HTML game elements. 

I used this project as an opportunity to teach myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript. One of the main challenges I faced was having my Javascript code access a 5-letter word .txt file to use to choose a word for the user to guess. It was difficult to access the .txt file locally, so I instead chose to fetch the file from this GitHub repo. In overcoming this challenge I learned about Javascript's asyncronous functions and promises.

## Running Wordle
To run the project, download the files and open them in Visual Studio Code. Then, use the Live Server extension to open the index.html file in a desired browser. Note, the game was made and texted using the Chrome broswer. Other browsers may not support functions in mainScript.js.
